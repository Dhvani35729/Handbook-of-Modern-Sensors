- "Chapter 3: "**Sensor Characteristics**""
  - "When selecting a sensor – the first thing to do is outline requirements for the particular application."
  - "Only after you know what you need, can you evaluate what is available."
  - "The evaluation starts by studying the sensor's **data sheet** that specifies all its essential characteristics."
  - "It is tempting to get the best available sensor, yet selecting a too good sensor means that you will be paying for an overkill – not a good engineering practice."
  - "In this chapter we review the most typical sensor characteristics and requirements that are usually specified in data sheets, or at least should be specified."
  - "Sensors for Mobile Communication Devices (MCD)"
    - "Mobile communication device examples: smartphones, smartwatches, tablets"
    - "For doing any useful job, an MCD needs information from the outside of its own shell by using a number of either external or built-in sensors and detectors."
      - "Some sensors are used for the human-to-MCD interface: "
        - "for receiving the operator's commands: keypad, microphone, accelerometer"
      - "while other sensors are for perceiving the environment: light, pressure, chemistry, etc."
    - "Currently built-in sensors are:"
      - "Imaging camera - takes still photo and video"
      - "Microphone - detects sound mostly in the audibly frequency range"
      - "Accelerometer - detects motion of the MCD and direction of the gravity force"
      - "Gyroscope - measures spatial orientation of the MCD"
      - "Magnetometer (compass) - detects strength and direction of magnetic fields"
      - "GPS - an RF receiver and processor for identifying global coordinates"
      - "Proximity detector - detects closeness of the MCD to the user's body"
    - "Requirements to MCD Sensors"
      - "The most important feature that an MCD sensor shall have is a full integration with the supporting components. The idea is that an MCD sensor shall be more than just a sensor, it has to be an integrated self-containing sensing module."

        - "![](https://github.com/Dhvani35729/Handbook-of-Modern-Sensors/blob/master/Chapter_3/reading/media/fig_3.1.png)"
        - "a sensing module can be:"
          - "a) embedded directly into the MCD housing"
          - "b) incorporated into a removable protective case (jacket) that envelops an MCD"
          - "c) be configured as an external device for plugging into one of the communication ports of an MCD"
          - "d) be totally external to an MCD and communicate with it wirelessly"
        - "Option b) is the most attractive from a convenience and practicality perspective"
    - "Integration"
      - "Integration of various functions into a sensing module is based on the reality that a sensing element rarely operates by itself"
      - "Example of a sensing module with an integrated noncontact infrared (IR) thermometer"
        - "![](https://github.com/Dhvani35729/Handbook-of-Modern-Sensors/blob/master/Chapter_3/reading/media/fig_3.2.png)"
        - "This module can be directly incorporated into an MCD housing (option a) or be part of a "smart" case (option b)"
  - "Span (Full-Scale Input)"
    - "A dynamic range of stimuli that may be converted by a sensor is called a span or an input full scale (FS)."
    - "It represents the highest possible input value, which can be applied to the sensor without causing unacceptably large error."
    - "For sensors with very broad and nonlinear response characteristics, the dynamic ranges of the input stimuli are often expressed in decibels."
      - "Decibels is a logarithmic ^^measure of ratios^^ of either power or force (voltage)"
        - "It should be emphasized that decibels do not measure absolute values, but a ****ratio**** of the values only."
      - "Decibel scale"

        - "![](https://github.com/Dhvani35729/Handbook-of-Modern-Sensors/blob/master/Chapter_3/reading/media/relative.png)"
    - "The logarithmic scale for small objects works as a microscope and for the large objects as a telescope."
    - "By definition, decibels are equal to ten times the log of the ratio of powers"
      - "$$1 dB = 10log(\frac{P_2}{P_1})$$"
    - "In a similar manner, decibels are equal to 20 times the log of the force, or current, or voltage:"
      - "$$1 dB = 20log(\frac{E_2}{E_1})$$"
  - "Full-Scale Output"
    - "For an analog output"
      - "The full-scale output (FSO) is the algebraic difference between the electrical output signals measured with maximum input stimulus and the lowest input stimulus applied."
    - "For a digital output"
      - "The FSO is the maximum digital count the A/D converter can resolve for the absolute maximum FS input."
    - "This must include all deviations from the ideal transfer function."
  - "Accuracy"
    - "A very important characteristics of a sensor is accuracy, which really means inaccuracy."
    - "Inaccuracy is measured as a highest deviation of a value represented by the sensor from the ideal or true value of a stimulus at its input."
    - "The true value is attributed to the input stimulus and accepted as having a specified uncertainty because one never can be absolutely sure what the true value is."
    - "The deviation from an ideal (true) transfer function can be described as a difference between the value that is computed back from the output and the actual stimulus value"
      - "deviation = measured - actual"
    - "![](https://github.com/Dhvani35729/Handbook-of-Modern-Sensors/blob/master/Chapter_3/reading/media/fig_3.3.png)"
    - "The specified accuracy limits generally are used in the worst-case analysis to determine the worst possible performance of the entire system"
    - "To improve accuracy, a number of the error-contributing factors should be reduced."
    - "This can be achieved by not fully trusting the manufacturer's specified tolerances, but rather calibrating each sensor individually under selected conditions."
    - "Clearly, calibration allows for more accurate sensing, however in some applications it may be prohibitive because of a higher cost."
    - "Often, inaccuracy (accuracy) is defined as a maximum, or typical, or average error."
    - "Inaccuracy rating may be represented in several forms, some of which are:"
      - "1. Directly in terms of measured value of a stimulus ($$\Delta$$)"
        - "This form is used when error is independent on the input signal magnitude."
        - "Often, it relates to additive noise or systematic bias, but also combines with all other conceivable error sources."
        - "Eg."
          - "0.15 ºC for a temperature sensor"
          - "10 fpm in the range from below 100 ft/min and 20 fpm in the range over 100 ft/min"
      - "2. In percentage of the input span (full scale)"
        - "This form is useful for a sensor with a linear transfer function and closely relates to form 1."
        - "It is just another way of stating the same thing because the input range must be specified for nearly any sensor."
        - "eg. 3% of the full scale"
      - "3. In percentage of the measured signal"
        - "This form is useful for a sensor with a highly nonlinear transfer function."
        - "It is a multiplicative way of expressing error because the error magnitude is shown as a fraction of the signal magnitude."
        - "eg. 3% of the measured signal"
        - "Using this form is not generally recommended because typically the error varies with a stimulus"
        - "It makes more sense to break up the total nonlinear span into smaller quasilinear sections and use form 2."
      - "4. In terms of the output signal."
        - "This form is useful for sensors with a digital output format so the error can be expressed, for example, in units of LSB."
    - "Which particular method to use? The answer often depends on the application."
    - "In modern sensors, specification of accuracy often is replaced by a more comprehensive value of uncertainty"
      - "because uncertainty is comprised of all distorting effects both systematic and random and is not limited to inaccuracy of a sensor alone"
  - "Calibration Error"
    - "Calibration error is the inaccuracy permitted when a sensor is calibrated in the factory."
    - "This error is of a systematic nature, meaning that it is added to all possible real transfer functions."
    - "It shifts accuracy for each stimulus point by a constant."
    - "This error is not necessarily uniform over the range and may change depending on the type of error."
    - "Another source of errors in calibration is a reference sensor."
      - "It is essential to use and maintain the high precision reference signal sources and/or sensors (meters) that are traceable to National standards"
  - "Hysteresis"
    - "A hysteresis error is a deviation of the sensor's output at a specified point of the input signal when it is approached from the opposite directions."
    - "![](https://github.com/Dhvani35729/Handbook-of-Modern-Sensors/blob/master/Chapter_3/reading/media/fig_3.5.png)"
    - "The typical causes for hysteresis are geometry of design, friction, and structural changes in the materials, especially plastics and epoxy."
  - "Nonlinearity"
    - "Nonlinearity error is specified for sensors whose transfer functions may be approximated by straight lines."
    - "A nonlinearity is a maximum deviation (**L**) of a real transfer function from the approximation straight line."
    - "The term "linearity" actually means "nonlinearity"."
    - "When more than one calibration run is made, the worst linearity seen during any one calibration cycle should be stated."
    - "Usually, it is specified either in percentage of a span, or in terms of the measured value."
    - "There are several ways of specifying nonlinearity, depending on how the line is superimposed on the transfer function"
      - "![](https://github.com/Dhvani35729/Handbook-of-Modern-Sensors/blob/master/Chapter_3/reading/media/fig_3.6.png)"
      - "One way is to use the terminal points"
        - "that is, to determine the output values at the smallest and highest stimuli and to draw a straight line through these two points"
        - "Here, near the terminal points, the nonlinearity error is the smallest and it is higher somewhere in between"
      - "Another way is to draw the approximation line through the calibration point, **c**"
        - "In some applications, higher accuracy may be desirable in particular narrower section of the input range."
        - "As a result, nonlinearity has the smallest value near the calibration point and increases toward the ends of the span"
      - "Independent linearity is referred to the so-called best straight line"
        - "which is a line midway between the two parallel straight lines closest together and enveloping all output values on a real transfer function"
        - "it is often used when all stimuli in the range are equally important"
    - "Depending on the specification method, approximation lines may have different intercepts and slopes."
    - "A user should be aware that manufacturers sometimes publish the smallest possible number to specify nonlinearity without defining what method was used."
  - "Saturation"
    - "Every sensor has its operating limits"
    - "Even if it is considered linear, at some levels of the input stimuli, its output signal no longer will be responsive."
    - "Further increase in stimulus does not produce a desirable output."
    - "It is said that the sensor exhibits a span-end nonlinearity or saturation"
    - "![](https://github.com/Dhvani35729/Handbook-of-Modern-Sensors/blob/master/Chapter_3/reading/media/fig_3.7.png)"
  - "![](https://github.com/Dhvani35729/Handbook-of-Modern-Sensors/blob/master/Chapter_3/reading/media/fig_3.8.png)"
    - "Repeatability"
      - "Repeatability (reproducibility) error is caused by the inability of a sensor to represent the same value under presumably identical conditions"
      - "The repeatability is expressed as a maximum difference between the output readings as determined by two run cycles, unless otherwise specified. "
        - "It is usually represented as a percentage of FS ("Span (Full-Scale Input)")"
          - "$$\delta_r = \frac{\Delta}{FS}100%$$"
      - "The possible sources of a repeatability error may be thermal noise, build up charge, material plasticity, etc."
    - "Dead Band"
      - "Dead band is the insensitivity of a sensor in a specified range of the input signals"
      - "In that range, the output may remain near a certain value (often zero) over an entire dead-band zone"
  - "Resolution"
    - "Resolution describes the smallest increment of a stimulus that can be sensed"
    - "When a stimulus continuously varies over the range, the output signals of some sensors will not be perfectly smooth, even under the no-noise conditions."
    - "The output be change in small steps."
    - "This is typical for sensors where the output signal change is enabled only upon a certain degree of stimulus variation."
    - "Besides, any signal that is converted into a digital format is broken into small steps where a number is assigned to each step."
    - "The magnitude of the input variation, which results in the output smallest step, is specified as a resolution under specified conditions (if any)"
    - "eg. resolution"
      - "for a motion detector: the minimum equidistant displacement of an object for 20 cm at a 5 m distance"
      - "for a wire-ground potentiometric angular sensor: a minimum angle of 0.5º"
    - "Sometimes, it may be specified as a percent of a full scale (FS)."
    - "It should be noted that the step size may vary over the range, hence, the resolution may be specified as typical, average, of worst. "
    - "The resolution of a sensor with a digital output format is given by the number of bits."
    - "For instance, resolution may be specified as "8-bit resolution"."
      - "This statement to make sense must be accomplished with either of FS value or the value of LSB (least significant bit)."
    - "Where there are no measurable steps in the output signal, it is said that the sensor has continuous or infinitesimal resolution."
  - "Special Properties"
    - "Special input properties may be needed to specify for some sensors."
    - "eg. light detectors are sensitivity within a limited optical bandwidth. Therefore, it is appropriate to specify for them a spectral response."
  - "Output Impedance"
    - "Output impedance $$Z_{out}$$ is important to know for better interfacing a sensor with an electronic circuit"
    - "Electrically, the output impedance is connected to the input impedance $$Z_{in}$$ of the interface circuit either in parallel (voltage connection) or in series (current connection)"
      - "![](https://github.com/Dhvani35729/Handbook-of-Modern-Sensors/blob/master/Chapter_3/reading/media/fig_3.9.png)"
    - "The output and input impedances generally should be represented in complex form, as they may include the reactive components (capacitors and inductors)."
    - "To minimize signal distortions, a current generating sensor should have an output impedance $$Z_{out}$$ as high as possible, while the interface circuit's input impedance should be low."
    - "Contrary, for the voltage connection, a sensor shall have a lower $$Z_{out}$$ while the interface circuit should have $$Z_{in}$$ as high as practical"
  - "Output Format"
    - "Output Format is a set of output electrical characteristics that are produced by the sensor alone or by its integrated excitation circuit and signal conditioner"
    - "The characteristics may include:"
      - "voltage"
      - "current"
      - "charge"
      - "frequency"
      - "amplitude"
      - "phase"
      - "polarity"
      - "shape of a signal"
      - "time delay"
      - "digital code"
    - "The most popular digital communication between an integrated sensor and peripheral device is a serial link"
      - "A serial link sends and receives bytes of information in a serial fashion – one bit at a time."
      - "These bytes are transmitted using either a binary format or a text (ASCII) format."
    - "For communicating an integrated sensor with a digital output format, the most popular formats are PWM (pulse-width modulation) and $$I^2C$$ and its variations."
      - "The $$I^2C$$ protocol was developed for sending data between the $$I^2C$$ devices over two wires."
      - "It sends information from a sensor to a peripheral device serially using two lines:"
        - "one line for data (SDA)"
        - "one for clock (SCL)"
      - "The protocol is based on a concept of the master and slave devices"
      - "The basic communication speed is selected between 0 and 100 kHz"
  - "Excitation"
    - "Excitation is the signal needed to enable operation of an active sensor"
    - "Excitation is specified as a range of voltage and/or current, or in some cases it may be light, magnetic field and any other type of a signal."
      - "For some sensors, the frequency and shape of the excitation signal, and its stability, must also be specified."
    - "Spurious variations in the excitation may alter the sensor transfer function, produce noise, and cause output errors."
    - "eg. an electric current passing through a thermistor to measure its temperature-dependent resistance"
  - "Dynamic Characteristics"
    - "Under the static conditions (a very slow-changing input stimulus) a sensor is described by a time-invariant transfer function, accuracy, span, calibration, etc."
    - "However, when an input stimulus varies with an appreciable rate, a sensor response generally does not follow it with perfect fidelity."
      - "The reason is that both the sensor and its coupling with the stimulus source cannot always response instantly."
      - "In other words, a sensor may be described by a time-dependent characteristics that is called dynamic."
    - "If a sensor does not respond instantly, it may represent the stimulus as somewhat different from the real, that is, the sensor responds with a dynamic error."
    - "The warm-up time characteristics is a time delay between applying power to the sensor or the excitation signal and the moment when the sensor can operated within its specified accuracy"
      - "This can range from negligible to seconds to even minutes."
    - "In [[Control Theory]], it is common to describe the input-output relationship through a constant-coefficient linear differential equation."
      - "Then, the sensor's dynamic (time-dependent) characteristics can be studied by evaluating such an equation."
    - "Depending on the sensor design, differential equations can be of several orders"
      - "Zero-Order"
        - "A Zero-Order sensor is characterized by a transfer function that is time-independent."
        - "0 energy storage components"
          - "like a capacitor."
        - "A zero-order sensor responds instantaneously."
          - "Naturally, nearly any sensor still has a finite time to response, but such time is negligibly short and can be ignored."
      - "First-Order"
        - "1 energy storage component"
        - "The relationship between the input s(t) and output E(t) is a first-order differential equation:"
          - "$$b_1\frac{dE(t)}{dt} + b_0E(t) = s(t)$$"
        - "Eg."
          - "A temperature sensor where the energy storage is a thermal capacity of the sensor within an encapsulation"
        - "A dynamic characteristics of a first-order sensor may be specified by a manufacturer in various ways"
          - "Frequency response"
            - "Specifies how fast the sensor can react to a change in the input stimulus"
            - "Express in Hz or rad/s to specify the relative reduction in the output signal at a certain frequency of the stimulus"
            - "The frequency response limit $$f_u$$ is often called the **upper cutoff frequency**, as it is considered the highest frequency that a sensor can process"
            - "The frequency response directly relates to a speed response."
          - "Speed response"
            - "defined in the units of input stimulus per unit of time"
            - "Another way of specifying speed response is by the time that is required by the output to reach an arbitrary, say 63 or 90%, level of a steady state or maximum response upon exposure to the input step stimulus."
            - "For the first-order response, it is very convenient to use the so-called **time constant**."
              - "Time constant $$\tau$$ is a measure of the sensor's inertia."
              - "In electrical terms, it is a product of the electrical capacitance and resistance: "
                - "$$\tau = CR$$"
              - "In thermal terms, a thermal capacity and thermal conductivity or thermal resistance should be used instead."
            - "Practically, a time constant can be easily measured."
            - "A solution of ("$$b_1\frac{dE(t)}{dt} + b_0E(t) = s(t)$$") gives the first-order system time response:"
              - "$$E = E_m(1-e^{\frac{-t}{\tau}})$$"
              - "$$E_m$$ = steady state settled output"
              - "t = time"
              - "e = base of natural logarithm"
              - "Substituting $$t = \tau$$, we arrive at:"
                - "$$\frac{E}{E_m} = 1 - \frac{1}{e} = 0.6321$$"
              - "This means that after the elapsed time is equal to one time constant, the sensor's response reaches about 63% of its steady state level $$E_m$$"
              - "Similarly, it can be shown that after two time constants, the transition will be at a 86.5 % level and after three time constants it will climb to 95 % of the value that would be reached after waiting infinitely long."
        - "How to specify, frequency or speed, depends on sensor type, application, and preference of a designer."
        - "The upper cutoff frequency shows how fast the sensor reacts while the lower cutoff frequency shows how the sensor can process a slow changing stimulus"
          - "![](https://github.com/Dhvani35729/Handbook-of-Modern-Sensors/blob/master/Chapter_3/reading/media/fig_3.11.png)"
        - "As a rule of thumb, a simple formula can be used to establish a connection between the cutoff frequency $$f_c$$ (either upper or lower) and a time constant in a first-order sensor:"
          - "$$f_c \approx \frac{0.159}{\tau}$$"
        - "A phase shift at a specific frequency defines how the output signal lags behind the stimulus."
          - "The shift is measured in angular degrees or rads and is usually specified for sensors that process periodic signal."
      - "Second-Order "
        - "2 energy storage components"

          - "$$b_2\frac{d^2E(t)}{dt^2} + b_1\frac{dE(t)}{dt} + b_0E(t) = s(t)$$"
        - "eg."
          - "An accelerometer that incorporates an inertial mass and a spring"
        - "A second-order response is specific for a sensor whose response includes a periodic signal."
          - "Such a periodic response may be very brief and we sat that sensor is damped"
          - "or it may be of a prolonged time and even may oscillate continuously"
            - "for many sensors, such a continuous oscillation is a malfunction and must be avoided"
        - "Any second-order sensor may be characterized by a resonant (natural) frequency, which is a number expressed in Hz or rad/s"
          - "The natural frequency shows where the sensor's output signal increases considerably while the stimulus does not."
          - "The resonant frequency may be related to mechanical, thermal, or electrical properties of the detector."
          - "Generally, the operating frequency range for a sensor should be selected well by or above the resonant frequency."
            - "However, in some sensors, a resonant frequency is the operating point."

          - "When a sensor's response is fast, but without an overshot, the response is said to be critically damaged."
          - "Underdamped response is when the overshot occurs and the overdamped response is slower than the critical"
          - "The damping ratio is a number expressing the quotient of the actual damping of a second-order linear sensor by its critical damping"
        - "Damping in a sensor may be performed by a special component (damper) that has viscous properties, for eg. – fluid (air, oil, water)"
        - "For an oscillating response, a damping factor is a measure of damping, expressed (without sign) as the quotient of the greater by the littlest of pair of consecutive swings in opposite directions of the output signal, about an ultimately steady-state value."
          - "Damping factor =$$\frac{F}{A} = \frac{A}{B} = \frac{B}{C} = …$$"
  - "Dynamic Models of Sensor Elements"
    - "To determine a sensor's dynamic response a variable stimulus should be applied to its inputs while observing the output values."
    - "Generally, a test stimulus may have any shape or form, which should be selected according to the practical need."
    - "A mathematical modeling of a sensor is a powerful tool in assessing its performance."
    - "A modeling may address both responses:"
      - "static"
      - "dynamic"
    - "The models usually deal with the sensor's transfer function."
    - "Here we briefly outline how some sensors can be evaluated dynamically."
      - "not intended to be exhaustive but rather to introduce the topic"
      - "For the analysis, a sensor is divided into simple elements and each element is considered separately"
      - "However, once the equations describing the elements have been formulated, individual elements can be recombined to yield the mathematical model of the original sensor"
    - "The dynamic models may have several independent variables, however, one of them must be time."
    - "The resulting model is referred to as a lumped parameter model."

      - "There are three basic electrical elements:"
        - "the capacitor"
        - "the inductor"
        - "the resistor"
      - "Refer to Kirchhoff's laws"
  - "Environmental Factors"
    - "Every sensor is subject to various environmental influences during both a nonoperational storage and operational functionality"
    - "All possible environmental factors that may affect the sensor performance are generally specified by manufacturers"
      - "Storage conditions"
        - "Storage conditions are the nonoperating environmental limits to which a sensor may be subjected during a specified period without permanently altering its performance when operating under normal conditions"
        - "Usually, storage conditions include:"
          - "highest and lowest storage temperatures"
          - "maximum relative humidities at these temperatures"
        - "Depending on the sensor's nature, some specific limitation for storage need to be considered."
          - "eg. maximum pressure, presence of some gases, or contaminating fumes"
      - "Short- and long-term stabilities (drifts) are parts of the accuracy specification"
      - "Short-term stability"
        - "manifested as changes in the sensor's performance within minutes, hours, or even days."
        - "Eventually, it is another way to express repeatability as drift may be bidirectional."
      - "Long-term stability (aging)"
        - "may be related to degrading of the sensors materials which is an irreversible change in the material's electrical, mechanical, chemical, or thermal properties"
        - "A long-term drift is usually unidirectional."
        - "Happens over usually months or years"
        - "Aging phenomenon is typical for sensors having organic components and, in general, is not an issue for a sensor made with only nonorganic materials."
        - "A powerful way of improving a long-term stability is to pre-age the sensor at extreme conditions."
          - "The extreme conditions may be cycled from the lowest to the highest."
          - "Such an accelerated aging not only enhances stability of the sensor's characteristics, but also improves reliability, as the pre-aging process reveals many hidden defects."
    - "Environmental conditions to which a sensor is subjected during normal operation do not include variables that the sensor measures."
    - "Some environmental conditions usually are of a multiplicative nature, that is, they alter a transfer function of the sensor, for instance changing a sensitivity."
    - "Environmental stability is a very important requirement."
    - "Temperature effects must be known and accounted for."
      - "The operating temperature range is a span of the ambient temperatures given by their upper and lower extremes wherein the sensor maintains its specified accuracy."
      - "Many sensor characteristics change with temperature and their transfer functions may shift significantly."
      - "Special compensating elements are often incorporated either directly into the sensor or signal condition circuits, to compensate for temperature errors."
      - "The simplest way of specifying tolerances of thermal effects is provided by the error-band concept, which is simply the error band that is applicable over the operating temperature band."
        - " A temperature band may be divided into sections while the error band is separately specified for each section."
      - "Temperatures will also affect the dynamic characteristics, particularly when they employ viscous daming."
        - "A relatively fast temperature change may cause the sensor to generate a spurious output signal"
      - "A self-heating error may be specified when an excitation signal is absorbed by a sensor and changes its temperature by such a degree that it may affect accuracy. "
  - "Reliability"
    - "Reliability is the ability for a product (sensor) to perform a required function under stated conditions for a stated period of time."
    - "Reliability can be expressed in statistical terms as the probability that the device will function without failure over a specified time or a number of uses."
    - "Reliability specifies a failure – a temporary or permanent malfunction of a sensor."
    - "While reliability is an important requirement, it is seldom specified however by the sensor manufacturers."
      - "Reason, perhaps, is the absence of a commonly accepted measure(s) for sensor reliability"
    - "MTTF"
      - "For many repairable electronic devices, the procedure for predicting the in-service reliability is the MTBF (mean-time-between-failures) whose calculating is described in MIL-HDBK-217 standard."
      - "Since sensors are, as a rule, nonrepairable devices and so after failure they should be replaced, not repaired."
      - "Thus sensors are more conveniently characterized by the MTTF (mean-time-to-failure), an average time of operation before the device fails."
      - "The MTTF determines the dependability of the device and is computed as:"
        - "$$MTTF = \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i}(t_{fi} - t_{0i})$$"
          - "$$t_0$$ = time of the test start"
          - "$$t_f$$ = time of failure"
          - "n = total devices tested"
          - "i = the number of a device"
        - "Each tested device shall run to its failure (recoverable or catastrophic) and the average work time till failure is computed"
      - "The MTTF tests should be performed under the extreme (off normal or typical) operating conditions"
    - "Extreme Testing"
      - "A device reliability can be inferred after tests at extreme conditions."
      - "One approach is 1000 h, loaded at maximum temperature."
      - "Extreme tests are especially helpful in the sensor design phase to uncover hidden problems."
      - "During the extreme tests, a sensor may be subjected to some strong environmental factors, which potentially can alter its performance or uncover hidden defects."
      - "Among additional testa that may reveal such issues are:"
        - "High temperature/high humidity, while being fully electrically powered"
          - "useful for detecting contaminations and evaluation of packaging integrity"
          - "sometimes called 85-85 test (temperature-humidity bias)"
        - "Mechanical shocks and vibrations may be used to stimulate adverse environmental conditions"
        - "Extreme storage conditions may be simulated"
        - "Thermal shock or temperature cycling (TC)"
          - "subjecting a sensor to alternate extreme conditions"
          - "helps to uncover die bond, wire bond, epoxy connections, and packaging integrity"
        - "To simulate sea conditions, sensors may be subjected to a salt spray atmosphere for a specified time."
          - "helps to uncover its resistance to corrosion and structural defects"
    - "Accelerated Life Testing"
      - "Also called accelerated life (AL) qualification"
      - "It is a procedure that emulates the sensor's operation, providing the real-world stresses, but compressing years into weeks."
      - "Three goals are behind such a test:"
        - "to establish MTTF"
        - "identify first failure points that can then be remedied by the design changes"
        - "identify the overall system practical lifetime"
      - "Environmental Acceleration"
        - "One possible way of compressing time is to use the same profile as the actual operating cycle, including maximum loading and power-on, power-off cycles, but expanded environmental highest and lowest ranges (temperature, humidity, and pressure)"
        - "Performance characteristics may be outside specifications, but must return to those when the device is brought back to the specified operating range."
        - "Getting maximum reliability information in short time and at minimum cost is the major goal of a manufacturer."
        - "At the same time, it is impractical to wait for failures, when the lifetime of typical today's sensors is hundreds of thousands of hours."
        - "Accelerated testing is therefore both a must and a powerful means in production."
      - "HALT Testing"
        - "To uncover potential problems during the R&D process, Highly Accelerated Life Testing (HALT) is currently widely employed in different modifications."
        - "In this testing the sensor is considered as a “black box” with no regard to its internal structure or functionality."
        - "HALT is for determining the product’s reliability weaknesses, assess its reliability limits, ruggedize the product by applying elevated stresses (not necessarily mechanical and not necessarily limited to the anticipated field stresses) that could cause field failures."
        - "Sometimes called "discovery" test"
        - "Over the years, HALT has demonstrated its ability to improve robustness through a "test-fail-fix" process."
      - "FOAT Testing"
        - "A highly focused and highly cost effective failure-oriented accelerated testing (FOAT) may be conducted in addition to and in some cases instead of HALT."
        - "Unlike HALT, FOAT concerns with the actual physical or chemical effects inside the sensor."
        - "The testing is based on a theoretical model of the transfer function and other properties of the device that can be analytically or numerically modeled."
        - "The FOAT’s objective is to use a particular predictive model (e.g., Arrhenius model) to confirm (after HALT is conducted) the actual mechanism of failure, and establish the numerical characteristics (activation energy, time constant, sensi- tivity factors, etc.) and to improve the design."
          - "The FOAT models allow to predict failures."
          - "Assumption: the model is valid for the sensor at the actual operating conditions"
        - "HALT can be used for "rough tuning" the device's reliability, while FOAT should be employed whenever "fine tuning" is needed."
        - "FOA T and HALT could be carried out separately, or might be partially combined in a particular accelerated test effort."
  - "Application Characteristics"
    - "Design, weight, and overall dimensions are geared to specific areas of application."
    - "Same with price."
  - "Uncertainty"
    - "Nothing is perfect in this World, at least in a sense that we perceive it."
    - "The reality is that every part produced is never ideal and carries an uncertainty of its properties."
    - "Any measurement system consists of many components, including sensors."
      - "Thus, no matter how accurate the measurement is, it is only an approximation or estimate of the true value of the specific quantity subject to measurement, that is the stimulus or measurand."
    - "The result of the measurement should be considered complete only when accompanied by a quantitive statement of its uncertainty."
      - "We simply never can be 100% sure of the measured value"
    - "When taking individual measurements (samples) under real conditions we expect that stimulus **s** is represented by the sensor as having a somewhat different value **s'** so that that error of measurement is expressed as:"
      - "$$\delta = s' - s$$"
    - "The difference between error ("$$\delta = s' - s$$") and uncertainty should be clearly understood"
      - "Error = what we unknowably get when we measure"
      - "Uncertainty = what we think how large that error might be"
    - "The International Committee for Weight and Measures (CIPM) considers that uncertainty consists of many factors that can be grouped into two classes or types:"
      - "A: those, which are evaluated by statistical methods"
      - "B: those, which are evaluated by other means"
    - "Generally, A components of uncertainty arise from random effects, while the B components arise from systematic effects"
    - "Type A"
      - "Type A uncertainty is generally specified by a standard deviation $$\sigma_i$$, equal to the positive square root of the statistically estimated variance $$\sigma_i^2$$, and the associated number of degrees of freedom $$v_i$$."
      - "For such a component the standard uncertainty is:"
        - "$$u_i = \sigma_i$$"
      - "Standard uncertainty represents each component of uncertainty that contributes to the total uncertainty of the measurement result."
      - "Evaluation of a Type A standard uncertainty may be based on any valid statistical method for treating data"
    - "Type B"
      - "Evaluation of a Type B of standard uncertainty is usually based on scientific judgement using all the relevant information available, such as:"
        - "Previous measurement data."
        - "Experience with or general knowledge of the behaviour and property of relevant sensors, materials, and instruments."
        - "Manufacturer’s specifications."
        - "Data obtained during calibration and other reports."
        - "Uncertainties assigned to reference data taken from handbooks and manuals"
    - "When both A and B uncertainties are evaluated, they should be combined to represent the combined standard uncertainty."
      - "This can be done by using a conventional method for combing standard deviations."
      - "This method is often called the law of propagation of uncertainty or as "root-sum-of-squares" or "RSS" method of combing uncertainty components estimated as standard deviations."
